Hi, I’m Ali Yağmur

I’m a Wordpress Developer. 

I also create small games and prototypes using Unity Engine.

I have studied English Language and Literature but that was mostly because I like literature. 

I have been working as a freelancer for more than 5 years now. I mostly created web pages using wordpress for local companies.
